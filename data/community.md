### Community

I am very active in the Polish AI community. I co-lead the only Polish chapter of [RLadies](https://rladies.org/) and organize meetups of [Warsaw R User Group] (https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/Spotkania-Entuzjastow-R-Warsaw-R-Users-Group-Meetup/) as well as volunteer in the [Why R? Foundation](https://whyr.pl/foundation/). 

I am also an active tutor and co-organizer of six workshops where I taught the basics of programming and data analysis to almost 1200 people. Aside from that, I was teaching in a more structured form as a teacher at Warsaw University of Technology, where I have designed and conducted five courses for 225 Data Science students. 


I have co-organized two international data science conferences Why R?, two student conferences DwuMIan, and one hackathon (Urban Sensors). 
My activity at AI community events is not limited to organization tasks, I have also presented my research during 16 conferences, meetups, and seminars.
